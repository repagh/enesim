======
+ In case of a bounds with 0 width or height, the draw is still called
+ Pass the surface when checking for bounds, this allows to know what renderer to use
  on the destination surface
+ Remove the renderers on the stripes
+ Remove the warnings
+ Add log levels on every subsystem/renderer
+ Make use of the flags on the surface draw function
+ We need to get rid of the hypot function, it is used on a lot places
  but with f16p16 values
+ We need to use the real types on the rendering functions
+ We need to simplify the real rendering functions into its own
  c file with its own struct, this way in the future we can reuse the
  algorithm for other backends
+ We need to use whenever possible functions for fixed point operations. This way later we can just
  create some #defines for them and we can easily change from 16.16 to 32.32 or stuff like that

+ Remove the mime parameter, we can autodetect it when loading
